# Exploring State and Props with a Counter App

This assignment is designed to introduce you to React's state and props in a simple way. You'll build a small counter application to learn how to manage state and pass data between components using props.

## Set Up the App:

1. Create a React app using create-react-app.
2. Create the following components:

- App: The main parent component.
- Counter: A child component that displays and controls the counter.

## Features to Implement:

1. State Management: Use the useState hook in the App component to manage the counter value.
2. Display the Counter Value: Pass the counter value from App to the Counter component using props.
3. Increment and Decrement:
   Add two buttons in the Counter component: "Increment" and "Decrement."
   When these buttons are clicked, call functions passed as props from the App component to update the counter value.
   4- Reset the Counter (Optional): Add a "Reset" button in the Counter component to reset the counter to 0.

## Styling (Optional):

Add basic styles to make the counter app visually appealing.
