## JavaScript: Build a Multiplication Table with Conditionals

### Objective:

Create a webpage that generates a multiplication table based on user input. The user will input a
number, and the table will be generated using a for loop. If the result of any cell is even, it will be
highlighted with a different background color.

### Instructions

1. HTML Part:

- Create a form with:
  - A text input field where the user can enter a number.
  - A button to trigger the multiplication table generation.
- Use pre-defined p elements to display the results.

2. JavaScript Part (functions and variables):

- Create a function generateTable() that runs when the button is clicked.
- Use a for loop to calculate and display the results inside the existing p elements.
- Use an if-else statement to check if the result is even or odd and adjust the text (or style)
  accordingly.
